# Portfolio Basic
This is really just a basic portfolio project, with nothing more then HTML, CSS, Tailwind and JavaScript / jQuery.

## Why so basic?
Most likely it is the first of a few versions of my portfolio, as I want to refresh my basics with HTML and JavaScript.
I'm pretty confident with basic to intermediate CSS so I opted into using Tailwind.css.
I really like it and want to get more experience with it.

## Few Versions?
I will gradually increase the level of frameworks/libraries used to get a good learning curve going for me.
Right now I want to try Vue.js in a later version and then maybe Laravel with Vue.js. 

I got some experience with Laravel beacuse I am working with it at my current employment, since March 2022.
