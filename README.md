# Portfolio Basic

This is really just a basic portfolio project, with nothing more then HTML, CSS, Tailwind and JavaScript / jQuery.

## Why so basic?
Most likely it is the first of a few versions of my portfolio as I wanna rework my basics with HTML, JavaScript.
I'm pretty sure about CSS so I opted into using Tailwind, as I really like it and wanted to get more used to it.

## Few Versions?
I wanted to gradually increase the level of frameworks/libraries used to get a good learning curve going for me.
Right now I want to try Vue.js in a later version and then maybe Laravel with Vue.js. 

I got some experience with Laravel as I am using it at my corrent employment, since March 2022.
